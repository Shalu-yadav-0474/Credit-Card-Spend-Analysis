# Credit Card Transaction Report
 ## Project Goal
 #### The goal of this project is to analyze customer data for a credit card company to better understand customer behavior and spending habits. It focuses on age-wise spending patterns, expense types, and card categories. The project also looks at customers with loans, revenue trends based on job roles, and customer distribution by card type. Additionally, it aims to evaluate average satisfaction ratings to identify areas for improvement and enhance customer experience.

## Stakeholder Questions 
1. 	What is the distribution of customers across different card categories (Blue, Platinum, Gold, and Silver)?
2. 	What is the current average customer satisfaction rating? 
3.  What is the distribution of customers based on their occupations, and how can we tailor our services to better address the needs of the largest and smallest segments?
4. 	What are the revenue figures on a quarterly and monthly basis?
5.	What are the primary spending categories for customers, and how can we align our offerings to enhance engagement in these areas?
6.	How do spending habits vary across different age groups, and what targeted approaches can we use to maximize engagement with high- and low-spending groups?
7.	What is the average customer acquisition cost for each card category, and how can we optimize this metric to increase profitability?
8.	How many customers own assets (e.g., cars or houses) or have loans, and for those without any assets or loans, what recommendations can be made to introduce suitable products or services to this segment?
